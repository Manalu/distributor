# Distributor
A simple web application for food & beverages distributor business domain. Specially made for Bangladesh market. The application is built using Codeigniter, so definitely this is using PHP/MySQL. The program covers most of the entities and wings of the business domain, and I am still trying to make it even more efficient in terms of business logic. Currently I have quite a few customers for the application. The project is completely open-source and also free to use. Any support required please do not forget to create an issue.
